Frankfurt (dpa) - Troubled Troubled German lender Deutsche Bank is thinking about cancelling millions in bonuses set aside for top managers as it tries to right its financial ship, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported Thursday.

Former bank heads such as Josef Ackermann, Juergen Fitschen and Anshu Jain could be affected. The paper reported that, in the case of Jain, the withheld sum could reach 5.3 million euros (5.7 million dollars). Ackermann could stand to lose out on 3.5 million euros.

Deutsche Bank would not comment on the report. However, in 2015, the company had noted in its annual report that it might have to consider withholding bonus payouts to some current and former top managers given its mounting financial problems.

The company, Germany's biggest bank, has been struggling to dig itself out of a hole created by lackluster returns in some of its biggest trading businesses and mounting legal costs.

The bank has had to pay steep fines after it was accused of misleading investors with questionable investments in the years around the financial crisis. It is still squabbling with US authorities about a possible 14-billion-dollar fine for allegedly  pushing questionable real estate investments. It hopes to lower the final payout.

Deutsche Bank reported a 6.8-billion-euro loss for 2015 and has not ruled out a loss again for this year as dpa reported earlier this month.
German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel recently slammed the management of Deutsche Bank  for how it has dealt with the latest bout of fears surrounding its financial stability. "I didn't know whether to laugh or get angry, that the bank that has made speculation its business model is now declaring itself the victim of speculation," said Gabriel, who also serves as deputy chancellor to Angela Merkel.
